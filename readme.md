#### My experience in Java
- I have 6 years experience in Java 
- I have 2 years experience on Spring , which was very long time ago , a spring project with xml configuration
- I have 2 years experience on Spring Boot for 2 different project

#### What I did
- add unit test & integration test
- improve swagger doc
- add caching for getEmployee api
- add basic authentication for api (username: user , password: password)
  - if using curl, add header 'Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA=='
- add custom api response
- add validation for field of Employee entity
- removal of setter injection
- fix bug of get value from optional without checking isPresent

#### What would have done if got more time
- increase test case coverage
- try to catch all exception into custom api error response
- add logging
- move string message to external config file and can support localization 
- implement JWT authentication
